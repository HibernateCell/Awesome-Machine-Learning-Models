Problem Statement: 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated in the early stages. I have built a model using various concepts of machine learning such as supervised and unsupervised learning, logistic regression and many more to help patients identify this problem and start their medication at the early stage. 

Project Title: 
Chronic Kidney Disease Analysis using Logistic Regression

Goal: 
The sole purpose of this model is to explain the concept of Logistic Regression so that user can understand its working and apply to their own projects.

Dataset Link: 
Here is the link to the Kaggle dataset.

Models used: 
I have used Logistic Regression.

What I had done: 
I have done the following things:
1.	Importing dataset
2.	Data Pre-processing
3.	Preparing dataset for training the model.
4.	Predicting the result 

Libraries needed: 
I have imported the following libraries:
1.	Numpy
2.	Matplotlib
3.	Pandas
4.	Seaborn
5.	Sklearn
6.	Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 
The model performance for training set: 
0.9841269841269841
