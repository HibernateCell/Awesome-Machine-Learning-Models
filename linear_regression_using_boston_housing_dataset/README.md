Problem Statement:
I have created this to explain the concept of Linear Regression using famous "Boston Housing Dataset". A Dataset derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.

Project Title:
Linear Regression using Boston Housing Dataset.

Goal:
The sole purpose of this model is to explain the concept of Linear Regression so that user can understand its working and apply to their own projects.  

Dataset Link:
Here is the link to the Kaggle dataset.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing

Models used:
I have used Linear Regression.

What I had done:
I have done the following things:
1) Importing dataset
2) Data Pre-processing
3) Exploratory Analysis
4) Correlation Matrix
5) Preparing dataset for training the model.

Libraries needed:
I have imported the following libraries:
1)	Numpy
2)	Matplotlib
3)	Pandas
4)	Seaborn
5)	Sklearn

Accuracy:
The model performance for training set:
RMSE is 5.6371293350711955
R2 score is 0.6300745149331701

The model performance for testing set
RMSE is 5.137400784702911
R2 score is 0.6628996975186952
